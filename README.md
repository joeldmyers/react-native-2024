# react-native-2024

Notes

- View is like div
- SafeAreaView - guaranteed to be below bar at top.
- Scrollview - like div that you can scroll
- Text - you have to wrap element in text to get text.
- have to do this inline style for each component - StyleSheet.create({ })

Use expo

Shake to open debugger.

Can do debugger to see console.log

Native styles don't have units. E.g., padding margin.

Everything is flex.

Can use styled components!
